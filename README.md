# ONLINE-CALUCLATOR
The objectives for creating an online calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be multifaceted. Here are some common objectives and goals:

Functionality: Ensure the calculator performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) accurately and reliably.

User Interface (UI): Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface with clear buttons, an input field to display the calculations, and a visually appealing layout for ease of use.

Responsiveness: Make the calculator responsive so that it functions well on various devices and screen sizes (desktops, tablets, mobile phones).

Error Handling: Implement error handling for invalid inputs or mathematical operations that cannot be performed, providing appropriate feedback to the user.

Code Readability and Maintainability: Write clean, well-structured, and maintainable code using appropriate coding practices, comments, and separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, JavaScript separation).

Accessibility: Ensure the calculator is accessible to all users, including those using assistive technologies. Use proper HTML semantics, labels, and ARIA attributes to enhance accessibility.

Testing and Debugging: Test the calculator thoroughly to identify and fix any bugs or issues that may arise during user interaction.

Optimization: Optimize the code for performance by minimizing unnecessary computations and improving the efficiency of the calculations.

Extension and Customization: Allow for potential future enhancements such as adding more advanced functions (exponentiation, square root, memory functions), custom themes, or scientific calculator capabilities.

Documentation: Provide clear documentation or comments within the code to aid in understanding the functionality, structure, and usage of the calculator for other developers or collaborators.
